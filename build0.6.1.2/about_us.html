  <h2>About JOT!</h2>

  <p>
  JOT! is a web application that allows users to upload notes and explore the notes
  their peers have posted for specific classes/groups. The interface is be primarily
  catered to those in the education sector, but will be an 'open' enough platform
  to be used for a wide variety of reasons, including note sharing between friends
  and colleagues.
  </p>

  <p>
  The primary goal is to enable and encourage a collaborative learning environ-
  ment. Essentially, the web app will allow users, chiefly students and educators,
  to register for specific classes in order to post their lecture notes and study
  materials. Other users, registered for that specific group, can then view these notes
  and use them to supplement their own study materials.
  </p>

  <p>
  Students often find it difficult to take perfect notes during a lecture
  and often miss out on writing some portion of the material. By allowing students to
  compile the information they have gathered from the lecture, they will have the
  opportunity to understand and revisit material they may have missed during class.
  </p>

  <p>
  The web app is organized such that users can explore classes/groups they
  are a part of, and can explore specific dates/units for those classes/groups. In
  these groups users are able to upload their notes for specific lecture dates.
  The primary file format for uploads is be PDF, a universal file format, which
  will allow others to view, but not to edit the note contents. The notes are stored
  and organized in the web application's backend database.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>

  <p>
  To increase collaboration and a sense of community between students by allowing
  them to access and learn from the notes of their peers, thus increasing their
  understanding of the material.
  </p>
