<h1> Description </h1>
<p>  “Jot” is a web app that will allow users to upload notes and explore the notes
their peers have posted for specific classes/groups. The product will be primarily
catered to those in the education sector, but will be an “open” enough platform
to be used for a wide variety of reasons, including note sharing between friends
and colleagues.
The primary goal is to enable and encourage a collaborative learning environ-
ment. Essentially the web app will allow users, chiefly students and educators,
to register for specific classes in order to post their lecture notes and study ma-
terials. Other users registered for that specific group can then view these notes
and use them to supplement their own study materials. Students often find it
difficult to take perfect notes during a lecture and often miss out on writing
some portion of the material. By allowing students to compile the information
they gathered from the lecture, they will have the opportunity to understand
and revisit material they may have missed during class.
The web app will be organized such that users can explore classes/groups they
are a part of, and can explore specific dates/units for those classes/groups. In
these groups users will be able to upload their notes for specific lecture dates.
The primary file format for uploads will be PDF, a universal file format, which
will allow others to view, but not to edit the note content. The notes will be
stored and organized in the web app’s backend database. </p>
